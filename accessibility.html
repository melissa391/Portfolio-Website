      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>Asda Groceries is a popular website operated by users with diverse access needs. This accessibility review was conducted to assess the extent to which the website supports these users to perform a common series of tasks on the website: selecting items, adding them to basket then setting up store pick-up.</p>
      <h3>Solution & Impact</h3>
      <p>The user journey was assessed against Deque’s ‘Accessibility Heuristics’ (bit.ly/31HVzh6). At each step of the user journey, I questioned whether the heuristics had been met and noted issues in a spreadsheet.</p>
      <p>For each issue, a redesign recommendation has been made. The recommendations were informed by Barclay’s ‘Inclusive Design Principles’ (http://bit.ly/2N3a6yw). WCAG 2.1 was also referred to.</p>
      <p>Wireframes, which portray the design recommendations, have been produced with Axure RP.<span id="footer"></span></p>
