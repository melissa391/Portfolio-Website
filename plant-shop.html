        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>Designing the information architecture for a website, which sells houseplants. The website houses a lot of technical content, such as house plant care advice and in-depth descriptions of each plant. It is essential that all the content on the website is discoverable and navigable, and the language used is meaningful to the target users.</p>

        <h3>Solution & Impact</h3>
        <p>Interviews were conducted in plant shops around South London with customers, shop assistants and owners. A domain model was produced with insights from interviews as well as from competitor reviews. Card sorts and tree tests, which were carried out with potential users, informed the design of the sitemap and user journey. Initial wireframes demonstrate navigation design, faceted filtering on product pages and audience-appropriate language.</p>
        <p>The interviews and competitor reviews improved understanding of the structure of the domain. By performing card sorts I was able to tap into the users’ understanding of the subject area and improve the categories in the global navigation. In order that users can refine the results according to specific metadata, faceted filtering has been implemented. The filters were placed on the left-hand side in order to fit with the users’ mental models. </p>
