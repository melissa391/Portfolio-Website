        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>This project was carried out during the summer months of 2019. During that time, the United Kingdom (UK) was set to leave the European Union (EU) on the 31st October. It was unclear whether the UK would leave the EU with a withdrawal agreement. If the UK leaves the without a deal, World Trade Organisation (WTO) tariffs will be applied on all UK exports to the EU.</p>
        <p>A review was conducted of articles published by mainstream media platforms, which showed a lack of coverage of no-deal tariffs. Additionally, there is no website dedicated to presenting how tariffs after a no-deal will impact food prices in the UK. At the start of the study, I predicted that the general UK populations’ understanding of no-deal tariffs was limited, due to the lack of information online or in the mainstream media.</p>

        <h3>Solution & Impact</h3>
        <p>I designed a website prototype, through many iterations, which presented information about no-deal tariffs. A test was designed, to measure users’ understanding of the tariffs, before and after their interaction with the website.</p>
        <p>A pilot study, followed by two rounds of testing, were carried out on several iterations of the website prototype. The first round of user testing employed the ‘guerrilla style’ (bit.ly/2FnSLx9). I approached people and asked them to perform several simple tasks in a cafe in Margate. The second round of tests were conducted by users remotely with an online testing tool.</p>
        <p>The study proved that the general UK populations’ understanding of no-deal tariffs is limited and that simple data visualisations on a website are effective at improving understanding. Additionally, presenting information about how no-deal tariffs will affect UK food prices, better engaged users and improved their understanding of the wider implications of no-deal tariffs. The beneficiaries of this project are any people, who are interested in a better understanding of the implications of moving to WTO tariffs.<span id="footer"></span></p>
